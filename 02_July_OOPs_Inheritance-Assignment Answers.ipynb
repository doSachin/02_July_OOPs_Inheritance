    "**`Inheritance:`**\n",
    ">- Inheritance in object-oriented programming is a mechanism that allows a new class (called the derived or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (called the base or superclass). This means that the subclass can reuse and extend the functionality of the superclass.  \n",
    ">- Inheritance is used in object-oriented programming to promote code reuse, establish hierarchies, facilitate polymorphism, and allow for customization and extension of existing classes. It helps in building modular, organized, and flexible codebases.\n",
    "\n",
    " **`KeyPoints:`**\n",
    "\n",
    ">- **`1. Inheriting Attributes and Methods:`** When a subclass inherits from a superclass, it automatically gains access to all the attributes and methods defined in the superclass. This includes both the data attributes and the behavior (methods) associated with the superclass.\n",
    ">- **`2. Code Reusability:`** Inheritance promotes code reusability by allowing subclasses to reuse code from the superclass. Instead of rewriting common functionality, subclasses can inherit and extend the behavior of the superclass, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.\n",
    ">- **`3. Hierarchy and Organization:`** Inheritance also helps in organizing classes into a hierarchy based on their relationships. Subclasses represent more specialized versions of the superclass, creating a clear and structured hierarchy of classes.\n",
    ">- **`4. Polymorphism:`** Inheritance plays a crucial role in achieving polymorphism, which allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This enables code flexibility and facilitates writing more generic and reusable code.\n",
    ">- **`5. Overriding and Extending:`** Subclasses can override methods from the superclass, providing their own implementation if needed. They can also add new methods or attributes specific to the subclass, thus extending the functionality of the superclass."

    "\n",
    "> **`Single Inheritance:`**\n",
    ">- In single inheritance, a class can inherit attributes and methods from only one parent class or superclass. This means that the subclass is directly derived from a single parent class, forming a hierarchical relationship.      \n",
    ">- Single inheritance enables a derived class to inherit properties from a single parent class, thus enabling code reusability and the addition of new features to existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    ">  **`Advantages of Single Inheritance:`**\n",
    ">- 1. **Simplicity:** Single inheritance tends to be simpler to understand and implement as it involves only one parent class.\n",
    ">- 2. **Ease of Maintenance:** With a single parent class, the class hierarchy is straightforward, making it easier to maintain and debug code.\n",
    ">- 3. **Less Ambiguity:** In single inheritance, there are no conflicts or ambiguities that arise from inheriting attributes or methods from multiple sources.\n",
    ">- 4. **Code Reusability:** It still promotes code reusability as subclasses can inherit and extend functionality from a single superclass.\n",
    ">- 5. **Hierarchy:** Single inheritance helps maintain a clear hierarchy of classes, making code organization more straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Multiple Inheritance:`**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **`Multiple Inheritance:`**\n",
    ">- In multiple inheritance, a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class or superclass. This means that the subclass can have multiple direct parent classes, each contributing its own set of attributes and methods.\n",
    ">- When a class can be derived from more than one base class this type of inheritance is called multiple inheritances. In multiple inheritances, all the features of the base classes are inherited into the derived class. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **`Advantages of Multiple Inheritance:`**\n",
    ">- 1. **Code Reusability:** Multiple inheritance promotes code reusability as a subclass can inherit and combine functionalities from multiple parent classes.\n",
    ">- 2. **Flexibility:** Multiple inheritance provides more flexibility in designing class hierarchies by allowing classes to inherit characteristics from diverse sources.\n",
    ">- 3. **Polymorphism:** Multiple inheritance supports polymorphism, where objects can exhibit different behaviors based on the interfaces or traits inherited from multiple superclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Differences:`**\n",
    "\n",
    ">- 1. **Complexity:** Multiple inheritance is more complex than single inheritance due to potential conflicts and ambiguities that can arise.\n",
    ">- 2. **Design Considerations:** Single inheritance is often preferred for simpler hierarchies, while multiple inheritance is suitable for more complex scenarios that require combining functionalities from multiple sources.\n",
    ">- 3. **Number of Superclasses:** Single inheritance allows a class to inherit from only one superclass, creating a linear hierarchy. Multiple inheritance allows  a class to inherit from multiple superclasses, leading to more complex class structures.\n",
    ">- 4. **Hierarchy:** Single inheritance follows a straightforward parent-child relationship, making the class hierarchy easy to understand. Multiple inheritance can result in a more intricate hierarchy with multiple parent classes, which requires careful design and management.\n",
    ">- 5. **Code Reusability:** Single inheritance still promotes code reusability as subclasses can inherit and extend functionality from a single superclass. Multiple inheritance greatly enhances code reusability as subclasses can inherit from multiple superclasses, reducing duplicate code. "
